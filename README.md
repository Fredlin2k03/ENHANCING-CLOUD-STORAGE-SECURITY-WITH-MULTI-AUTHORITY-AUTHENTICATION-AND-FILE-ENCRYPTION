Our security framework employs Two Factor Authentication (2FA), enhancing its reliability by utilizing Cross Server Verification integrated with Django-Rest API. A paramount feature of the system is its advanced encryption methodology, leveraging both FerNet and AES protocols. To further amplify data security, the system incorporates a strategy to fragment files or data into discrete chunks. These segmented data pieces are then securely stored within a container, while the associated metadata finds its residence in an SQL server. Such an approach not only guarantees heightened data protection but also streamlines retrieval processes
